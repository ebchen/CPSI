Code from the Competitive Programming Summer Institute @ University of Central Florida (July 2018)

In July, 2018, I attended the Competitive Programming Summer Institue at the University of Central Florida.
For 2 weeks, I learned algorithms and data structures to be utilized in computer programming competitions like USACO.
In this repository are some selected source files that contain my solutions to the five contests we had during the camp.
